            The data is obtained by automatic crawling http://pilpres2014.kpu.go.id periodically and updated every 6-12 hours.
            This website is not an official KPU website and although the numbers are automatically crawled from pilpres2014.kpu.go.id you should not treat this as official numbers.

            DA1 data that is sent from the District is a result that has been decided on its level and not at the national level and not the final results because the data may change according
            to the results of a plenary meeting on the level above or at the level of the central plenum.

            The motivation for this website is to make the #pilpres2014 data available to public as quick as possible with the widest possible reach and so that the world can be the Watchdogs
            for an honest, clean, respectable and integral democracy process.
